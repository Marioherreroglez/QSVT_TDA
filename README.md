# Quantum Singular Value Transform and Topological Data Analysis:

The problem chosen to analyze is given by the paper *"[A streamlined quantum algorithm for topological data analysis with exponentially fewer qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12887)"*

### Definitions:
- A **streamlined quantum algorithm** is a type of algorithm that uses quantum computing to solve problems more quickly than traditional methods.
It is designed to be more efficient and faster than existing algorithms, and can be used to analyze and classify data in machine learning applications.
- Topological data analysis is a method of analyzing data that uses algebraic topology to classify topological objects. It is used to identify patterns in data that are robust to noise and perturbations, and can be used to interpret datasets, compare different datasets, and as input to machine learning models.

- **Persistent Betti Numbers** are a type of topological invariant that measure the number of holes in a given space. They are used to track how the number of holes changes over time, and can be used to identify features in a data set. A topological invariant is a property of a space that remains unchanged under continuous deformations. It can be used to classify different shapes and spaces, as well as measure the complexity of those shapes.

### Talks on QSVT:
- 
An n-qubit quantum circuit performs a unitary operation on an exponentially large, $2^n$-dimensional, Hilbert space, which is a major source of quantum speed-ups. We show how Quantum Singular Value Transformation can directly harness the advantages of exponential dimensionality by applying polynomial transformations to the singular values of a block of a unitary operator. The transformations are realized by quantum circuits with a very simple structure – typically using only a constant number of ancilla qubits – leading to optimal algorithms with appealing constant factors. We show that this framework allows describing and unifying many quantum algorithms on a high level, and enables remarkably concise proofs for many prominent quantum algorithms, ranging from optimal Hamiltonian simulation to quantum linear equation solving (i.e., the HHL alorithm) and advanced amplitude amplification techniques. Finally, we also prove a quantum lower bound on spectral transformations.
