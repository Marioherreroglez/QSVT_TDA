# QSVT_TDA:
The problem chosen to analyze is given by the paper *"[A streamlined quantum algorithm for topological data analysis with exponentially fewer qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12887)"*

### Definitions:
- A **streamlined quantum algorithm** is a type of algorithm that uses quantum computing to solve problems more quickly than traditional methods.
It is designed to be more efficient and faster than existing algorithms, and can be used to analyze and classify data in machine learning applications.
- Topological data analysis is a method of analyzing data that uses algebraic topology to classify topological objects. It is used to identify patterns in data that are robust to noise and perturbations, and can be used to interpret datasets, compare different datasets, and as input to machine learning models.
